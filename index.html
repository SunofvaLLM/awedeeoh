What is Awedeeoh?
Awedeeoh is a professional-grade, real-time audio processing application that functions as a "software hearing aid on steroids." It captures audio from any microphone and passes it through a sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) pipeline‚Äîa series of advanced audio effects‚Äîto output a finely tuned, enhanced result to your headphones with minimal latency.

Core Features
üé§ Live Audio Passthrough
Optimized for near-zero latency, ensuring the audio you hear is perfectly synchronized with the world around you.

üîä Advanced Compressor
Intelligently amplifies quiet sounds while taming loud ones, with full control over Threshold, Ratio, Attack, and Release.

üó£Ô∏è Speech Focus Filter
Isolates the typical frequencies of human speech to dramatically improve clarity in noisy environments.

üíæ Custom Presets
Save and load custom audio enhancement profiles as `.json` files to instantly switch between configurations.

ü§ñ Voice Control (NLP)
Utilizes the offline `vosk` engine to control core functions hands-free, ideal for fieldwork or surveillance.

üìº High-Quality Recording
Save the fully enhanced audio output directly to a lossless `.wav` file for documentation or analysis.

Use Cases
Awedeeoh is a versatile tool designed for a variety of applications:

Accessibility: Functions as a powerful, configurable hearing aid to enhance conversations and environmental sounds.
Security & Surveillance: Monitor environments for faint sounds, listen for distant conversations, or enhance audio from security feeds.
Fieldwork & Nature Observation: Amplify the subtle sounds of wildlife for research or hobbyist purposes.
Paranormal Investigation: Use extreme sensitivity presets to listen for Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP).
Personal Amplification: Overcome noisy environments like restaurants or public transport by focusing on the sounds you want to hear.
